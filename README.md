* Gorm is released under the GPL - see the file 'COPYING' for details.
* Documentation for Gorm is located in the Documentation directory.
* Please see the README files in each of the subdirectories for more complete information.

## Organization

* Gorm is comprised of the GormCore, InterfaceBuilder, and GormObjCHeaderParser libraries/frameworks as well as the Gorm application and gormtool
* The purpose of this organization is so that Gorm's functionality can be re-used in other applications.
