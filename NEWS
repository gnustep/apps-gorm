21 Noteworthy changes in version '1.0.2'
========================================

This is a bugfix release.

   * Fixed some bugs with table column selection.
   * Corrected a minor problem in the custom class inspector.

22 Noteworthy changes in version '1.0.0'
========================================

PLEASE NOTE: This version of Gorm requires base 1.11.1 and gui 0.10.1 to
be installed (gnustep-startup-0.13.0).

   * All inspectors are now modeled in .gorm files.
   * Added autosizing to form attributes inspector.
   * Utilize and maintain parent/child data structure more pervasively
   * Reorganized code in palettes for cleaner implementation.
   * Removed code to check for user bundles, since bugs in Camaelon
     which prompted those changes were fixed long ago.
   * Added documentation to GormCore

23 Noteworthy changes in version '0.11.0'
=========================================

   * Improved implementation of canSubstituteForClass: the default
     implementation of this method tests the classes to see if
     initWithCoder: or encodeWithCoder: is implemented on a subclass to
     determine automatically if that class has the same encoding
     signature as the original class, if it does, it can be substituted.
   * Improved handling of classes which use cell classes in the custom
     class inspector.  The inspector now autmatically replaces the cell
     class with the appropriate one when the user selects a given
     subclass.
   * Browser based class editor in document panel.  This interface is
     more like the one on OSX. The user now has a choice in preferences
     to determine which view they would like to use.
   * Translation tools.  The Document->Translate menu allows the user to
     export string and import strings in the strings format, so that
     someone can easily translate just the strings in the file and
     doesn't need to directly edit anything in Gorm.  The strings file
     can then be loaded back into Gorm and all of the relevant strings
     are updated.
   * Alignment tools.  In the new Layout menu there are options to align
     views, center views, bring views to front or push them to the back
     of the view layers.
   * Implementation of IBViewResourceDraggingDelegate.  This allows
     updating of the pull down in the inspectors panel dynamically.  It
     requires the developer of a palette to implement some code to
     enable this, as on OSX.
   * Lots of bugfixes and usability changes are also included in this
     release.

24 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.10'
=========================================

   * Gorm now has a full implementation of canSubstituteForClass: which
     is used to determine if a class can be substituted in the custom
     class inspector.  This allows classes added in palettes to say
     whether or not they can be used as a subsitute for a kit class.
   * Better separation of Gorm into libraries.  As well as the ability
     to compile on windows with a simple: "make install"
   * Implementation of IBResourceManager class.  This class is used by
     palettes to register drag types to be considered by the top level
     editors in the document window: object, sound, image, class.
   * Gorm now is able to switch views in the document window when you
     drag a file into it.  If it's an image it will switch to the image
     view, if it's a sound, the sound view, an object the object view
     etc or if it's a class (a .h file) it will switch to the classes
     view.
   * Drag and drop parsing of header files (if you hadn't gathered from
     the previous item).
   * Better support for standalone views.  while the user cannot
     instantiate from the classes view (there were too many problems
     with this approach).  They can now drag any view from the palette
     into the objects view and have it work.
   * A myriad of bug fixes.

25 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.2'
========================================

NOTE: This is mainly a bugfix release.

   * Some improvements to the procedure for removing connections.
   * Corrected various issues with header parsing.
   * Now closes windows which were opened during interface testing such
     as font panels, info panels, etc.
   * Minor corrections to background color for a number of inspectors.
   * Improvements to gmodel importation.
   * Better detection of when the user is utilizing a user bundle.  Gorm
     will now warn the user with a panel.
   * Various improvements in documentation

26 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.0'
========================================

   * Images/Sounds can now be dragged into a matrix cell.
   * Fully implemented date and number formatter inspectors (these
     classes still need work in GUI).
   * Added warning panel if the user attempts to edit a .gorm file
     created with a newer version of Gorm
   * Modified data.classes format so that only those actions
     specifically added to FirstResponder are listed.
   * Greatly improved gmodel importation.  (experimental)
   * It's now possible to add methods to classes which are not custom.
     This allows the user to add actions which may have been added to
     those classes by categories.
   * Completely new header parser implemented.
   * Improved cut/paste.  It's now possible to use cut/paste from almost
     anywhere.  The class editor now fully supports it.
   * Improved implementation of some of the InterfaceBuilder framework
     classes.
   * Object editor will now remove all instances of a class that has
     been deleted from the class editor.
   * The class inspector and the classes view will now apply stricter
     rules to names of actions and outlets to ensure that they are
     properly entered.
   * All inspectors work perfectly with customized colors.
   * Fixed a number of bugs.

27 Noteworthy changes in version '0.8.0'
========================================

PLEASE NOTE: It is important for this release that you upgrade to Gorm
0.8.0 when using Gorm with the new GNUstep libraries (base-1.10.0 and
gui-0.9.4).  This version of Gorm contains some features which are
reliant on changes made in those versions of the libraries.  It is
stated in Gorm's documentation (the Gorm.texi file) that this is
required, but I felt it important enough to also mention it here so that
it is known beyond a reasonable doubt.

   * New gorm file version.
   * Full custom palette support
   * Palette preferences panel to allow the user to configure palettes
     to load
   * Experimental: Standalone views.  This feature is to allow the use
     of a view without the need of a containing window.  This allows
     developers to treat these views as they would any other top level
     object in the .gorm file.  This is experimental functionality.
   * Improved NSTableColumn inspector.  The new inspector allows the
     user to change the data cell used for a given column.  This allows
     the user to select from a list of cell subclasses and set the
     appropriate custom or non-custom one they want to appear in that
     column of the table.
   * Improved layout of some of the inspectors.
   * Removed old class parser.  The parser was somewhat buggy and was
     actually causing some issues.  A new parser will be available in
     the next version of Gorm.  For now users will need to use the class
     inspector or the outline view to enter classes into Gorm.
   * Experimental: "File" section.  This is essentially a per-file
     preference which allows the user to control which version of
     GNUstep a given file will be compatible with.  It also lists the
     potential compatibility issues with the selected version.
   * Improved controls palette.  New items for some of the standard font
     replace the old "Title" widget which was a System-14 font.  The new
     widgets use a selection of the standard System font to allow the
     user to easily build a gui using these and reducing the amount of
     time the user needs to spend fiddling with the font panel.

28 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.7'
========================================

   * Important bugfixes in editor classes.
   * Rearranged some of the editor classes to be in the palettes which
     contain the classes they are responsible for editing
     (GormButtonEditor & GormTabViewEditor).
   * Image and Sound editors will now display system default images or
     sounds if they are available.
   * Document window now uses an NSToolbar (experimental).
   * Improved the layout of some of the inspectors.
   * Corrected some minor issues in the inspectors
   * Added code to allow NSTableView and NSOutlineView to show some data
     during testing
   * Gorm will now show an alert panel when a model fails to load or
     test properly.

29 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.6'
========================================

This release is mainly a bugfix release for 0.7.5.

   * Improved .gmodel support
   * Corrections to previous repair feature.
   * Important bugfixes for Menu editing.
   * Important bugfixes for class inspector.

30 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.5'
========================================

   * The 'reparent' feature in the class inspector.  This allows the
     user to change the class hierarchy from within Gorm.
   * Some important bugfixes
   * a property 'GormRepairFileOnLoad' (untested) which should repaire
     old .gorm files...  It is HIGHLY recommended that Gorm not be run
     with this on constantly and that you back up any files which you
     want to repair before opening them with this option turned on.
   * A shelf inspector in prefs that lets you expand the size of the
     names in the object view..
   * Support for NSFontManager
   * A way to restore a complete NSMenu if it's deleted (a new palette
     entry for NSMenu, not just an item)

31 Noteworthy changes in version '0.6.0'
========================================

   * Several major bugs corrected.
   * Clarified some of the inspectors
   * Menu items are now properly enabled/disabled when appropriate
   * More descriptive title displayed when a class is being edited.

32 Noteworthy changes in version '0.5.0'
========================================

   * Enabled defer in NSWindow inspector.
   * Added code to the connection inspector to prevent erroneous
     connections.
   * Added support for upgrading of old .gorm files using the older
     template mechanism
   * Grouping with an NSSplitView now operates using the relative
     positions of the views in the window.
   * Custom Class inspector now shows all subclasses, not just direct
     custom subclasses.
   * Bug fixes, eliminated memory leak, code cleanup, etc.

33 Noteworthy changes in version '0.4.0'
========================================

   * New Menu and Menu Item inspectors.
   * User can now specify the Services and Windows menus in the menu
     inspector.
   * User can specify a non-custom subclass as well as a custom one to
     replace the class when the .gorm is unarchived.  This can be used
     to turn a NSTextField into NSSecureTextField and etc.
   * New set name panel.
   * New switch control on the font panel to allow the user to specify
     if a font is encoded with its default size or not.
   * Added NSStepper and NSStepperCell to the class list to allow
     creation of custom subclasses.
   * Windows and Services menus now function correctly.

34 Noteworthy changes in version '0.3.1'
========================================

   * New custom class system.
   * Images now persist correctly when added to a button or view.
   * Fixed DND
   * Various bugfixes

35 Noteworthy changes in version '0.3.0'
========================================

   * Preferences added.
   * User can now enable and disable guidlines for easier editing.
   * Refactored code into GormLib which is a clone of the
     InterfaceBuilder framework.  This facilitates creating palettes and
     inspectors outside of Gorm.
   * Added class inspector for easier editing of classes.  This gives
     the user the option to use either the outline view or the inspector
     to edit new classes.
   * Added inspectors for the following: NSScrollView,
     NSProgressIndicator, NSColorWell, GormImageInspector (for images
     added to .gorm files).
   * Improved look of NSTabView inspector.
   * Removed all warnings from the code.
   * various bug fixes.

36 Noteworthy changes in version '0.2.5'.
=========================================

Many fixes and improvements to make the app work better.

   * Better parsing of headers
   * Interface code redone as gorm files.
   * Re-add multiple selection via mouse drag.

37 Noteworthy changes in version '0.2.0' snapshot.

Gobs of improvements, mostly due to the hard work of Gregory John
Casamento and Pierre-Yves Rivaille.  Thanks guys!

   * Custom class support/translations implemented.
   * Added NSScrollView, NSPopupButton, NSOutlineView, NSTableView
     editing.
   * Improved test mode support.
   * Improved drag n' drop support on many items.
   * Intelligent placement hints.

     matrices and/or increase decrease rows and cols.
   * Edit NSForms titles in place.
   * Edit NSBoxes and add subviews.
   * Support for custom objects.

40 Noteworthy changes in version '0.0.2'
========================================

   * Add popup and pulldown menu controls
   * Menu support
   * More inspectors
   * Some support for connections
   * Much more fleshed out - too numerous to mention.

41 Noteworthy changes in version '0.0.1'
========================================

   * 8th December 1999

        * Save/Load 'nib' documents (binary archived data)

          This works so far as it can be tested - but that's just
          archives containing windows or panels so far.

        * Load palettes

          Loading of palettes works.  You can load palettes from the
          'Tools' menu.  Gorm automatically loads all the palettes from
          its Resources directory.

        * Basic framework

          So far, the app provides a basic framework that needs fleshing
          out.
             * It has a palettes manager object that allows you to
               select a palette and drag items from the palette into
               your document.

             * It has a special per-document editor object, which keeps
               track of a matrix of icons representing the top-level
               objects in the document.

             * It has an inspector manager class, which updates the
               inspector panel when the selected object is changed by an
               editor.

             * It has special inspectors for handling an empty selection
               or a multiple selection.

        * Palettes

          Four palettes (three of which are empty at present) are built
          and installed in the apps Resources directory.

          The Window palette is more fully fleshed out than the other
          palettes.  It permits windows and panels to be created in
          Gorm.  If provides the start of a window attributes inspector.

   * 18 December 1999

        * You can drag views from a palette into a window or panel.
        * You can select views in a window by clicking on them,
          shift-clicking (for multiple selection), or click-drag on the
          window background to select views in a box.
        * You can delete/cut/copy/paste views betwen windows.
        * You can move views in a window by clicking on them and
          dragging.
        * You can resize views by clicking on their knobs and dragging.
        * You can control-drag to mark source and destination views for
          a connection.

        * Next task - inspectors.

          The connection inspector needs to be implemented to complete
          the process of establishing connections.  The size inspector
          needs to be implemented to set autosizing parameters for a
          view.

          Once these are done, the object editor needs to be made to
          support connections so that we can connect between objects
          other than views, then we need to write a menu editor.

   * 22 December 1999

        * Connections inspector is now working - but it needs some
          effort to tidy it up.
        * Class info (outlets and actions) is specified in
          'ClassInformation.plist' and needs to be present so that the
          app knows what outlets/actions an object has (and therefore
          what connections can be made).

        * The view size inspector is working - allowing you to set the
          size of the subviews within a window.

        * The attributes inspector for 'FilesOwner' is working, so you
          can define the class of the files owner (it defaults to
          NSApplication).

        * There is a crude panel for setting the name of the selected
          object.

        * I've created a couple of new images and got rid of the two
          NeXT images that were lurking in there.

        * There is a Testing directory, with a GormTest application that
          lets you load a nib for testing - it assumes that the nib will
          set its FilesOwners delegate to point to a window, and makes
          that window the key window ...

   * 23 December 1999

     Last work before christmas ...

     Various bits of tidying up plus -

     Added an evil hack of a generic attributes inspector ...  This
     looks through all the methods of the selected object to find those
     taking a single argument and beginning with 'set'.  It makes all
     these setting methods (whose argument is a simple scalar type or an
     object) available for you to invoke from the inspector panel.

     This makes it possible to set pretty much any attribute of any
     object, but you do need to have the GNUstep header files to hand,
     so you can tell what numeric values to enter to achieve a desired
     result.
