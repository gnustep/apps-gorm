GormLib is a clone of the InterfaceBuilder framework.  

GormLib's primary purpose is to allow the creation of custom palettes and
inspectors outside of Gorm.  This will also facilitate extension of Gorm 
since it will allow outside applications to have an interface with which they
can interact with the running Gorm application.

You must install this library before you can build Gorm.
