This is version @value{GORM-VERSION} of Gorm.

@section What is Gorm?

Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or perhaps
GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for GNUstep.

Gorm is not `gormless' (a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents used when they
spotted me staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).
