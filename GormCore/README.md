# GormCore framework

This framework is the heart of the Gorm application.  It contains all of the classes needed to interact with a Gorm file.
The Gorm application uses it, obviously, and it is also used by gormtool to provide access to certain features from the
command line.

This framework allows Gorm features to be used in other applications either directly or through the use of Plugins.
